# Projects
PLEASE IGNORE THE .PROJECT FILES, THESE ARE NOT REQUIRED FOR THE GAME AS THEY ARE A PRODUCT OF MY DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT(ECLIPSE) 

When working on something that will become part of the code, try to work in an existing file if appropriate (see the fact we have 2 copies of items.py, one in the modules folder and one at the top of the repository) This is so when I accept the changes, they integrate automatically, rather than just making a new file and then having to be copied over.
