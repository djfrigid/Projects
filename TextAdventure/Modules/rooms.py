print('''Out into the rain in misrable Cardiff you go, after reading an article about the amount of 
	deaths caused by pharmacy errors(1 in 1000!).
	You are hunched over with a cigarette in your mouth, it goes out seconds after it was lit after 
	a BMWx5 sped through a puddle.
	Treating yourself to Tescos' 3 pound meal deal, you arrive at the pharmacy. The slippers you 
	are wearing are visibly soaked, they squelch as you approach the counter. The woman
	behind it looks at you judgingly, visibly unimpressed, and when you ask for a box of flu medicine,
	she returns squinting at the box in her hand, seemingly unable to read it without
	her glasses. She hands you a box of 'Oddssydinazacitidine'.
       
       'POSSIBLE SIDE AFFECTS MAY INCLUDE':
        *Causing serious tranformation of reality, passing body and mind to hyperquantum capacities,
        *Magicular particles in your vicinity may double to relative inevitability,
        *Fractal dimensions above infinity+1 collapsing into a finite equilibrium.
        *Mild nausea
        *Drowsiness
        
        You take it politely without question, reasoning that 1 in 1000 is a tremendously small percentage...
        As you start the 10 minute walk back to your lectures, you pop 3 of the little yellow pills.
        Suddenly you heart starts to thump, your knees become weak...
